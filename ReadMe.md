## INSTRUCTIONS
Disclaimer: I am pretty sure this only works on Windows OS

<pre>
Use Visual Studio 2022
Load the project
In the build setting you MUST set either x64 or x86 architecture.
Build the project
Get the Discord GameSDK ( https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide )
In the SDK's files, add the dll files that match the selected architecture above
Run the thing and boom (discord must be open for it to work)
